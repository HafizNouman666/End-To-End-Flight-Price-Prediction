# END-TO-END-FLIGHT-PRICE-PERDICTION 

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project for predicting flight prices based on user inputs, developed using a Flask web application. The model has been trained on a dataset of flights and uses several features, such as departure and arrival times, airline, and flight duration, to make price predictions. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, API development, and deployment in a Flask environment.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to predict the prices of flights based on specific input features. The machine learning model has been trained using a dataset of flight prices and is served through a Flask web application. Users can input details such as the airline, departure and arrival times, stops, and flight duration, and the model will return a predicted price.

## Features

- **Model Training**: A machine learning model has been trained on historical flight price data.
- **Flask API**: A Flask API serves the model and allows for easy predictions.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface to input flight details and get price predictions.
- **GitHub Repository**: Daily commits track the project's progress and improvements.

## Data

The dataset includes flight details such as:
- Airline
- Date of Journey
- Source and Destination
- Route
- Departure and Arrival Time
- Duration
- Total Stops

The data has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate predictions. Feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance model performance.
